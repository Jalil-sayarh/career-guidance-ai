O*NET 27.1 Database

157 technology skills, related to 892 occupations via 10,707 linkages, were identified as “Hot Technologies” using an updated approach.
2,515 technology skill linkages were identified as “In Demand” for 478 occupations.
641 technology skill linkages related to 215 occupations were added from employer job postings.
18 alternate titles related to 13 occupations were added from customer input and other sources.
This release updates the approach to identifying “Hot Technologies” and introduces the concept of “In Demand” technology skills.

Hot Technologies are software and technology requirements most frequently included across all employer job postings.
In Demand technology skills are software and technology requirements frequently included in the employer job postings for a particular occupation.
The purpose of the two designations is to enable O*NET customers to learn which technology skills employers in the US economy are presently emphasizing and searching for while recruiting employees. For additional details on the Hot Technology and In Demand designations, see Hot Technologies and In Demand Technology Skills within the O*NET System in our Reports and Documents area.

O*NET 25.1 Database – Updating the O*NET-SOC Taxonomy

The O*NET-SOC 2019 taxonomy structure has been revised based on the transition to the 2018 SOC. The O*NET 25.1 Database, which incorporates the new O*NET-SOC taxonomy, includes 1,016 occupational titles, 923 of which represent O*NET data-level occupations.

A technical report, Updating the O*NET-SOC Taxonomy: Incorporating the 2018 SOC Structure, is available which describes the new O*NET-SOC 2019 taxonomy structure. The overall relationship between the O*NET-SOC 2019 and the 2018 SOC is summarized. Code, title, or description changes that occurred from transitioning to the new 2018 SOC structure are detailed in the report. The new O*NET-SOC 2019 structure also includes four cybersecurity-related new and emerging occupations.

For a graphical overview of the new structure see: About the O*NET-SOC 2019 Taxonomy

Data from the O*NET 25.0 database (O*NET-SOC 2010) has been incorporated into the new O*NET-SOC 2019 taxonomy, including the new O*NET-SOC codes, titles, and descriptions. In the 25.1 release, taxonomy-related updates include:

In these cases, data is marked with “Analyst - Transition” in the Domain Source column. Some ratings, including Education, Training, and Experience ratings, are not available. These occupations will be updated through the O*NET Data Collection program with data from job incumbents and occupation experts, replacing the transitional data in future releases of the O*NET Database.

O*NET Database 15.1 – Updating the O*NET-SOC Taxonomy

The O*NET 15.1 Taxonomy Preview Database aligns the O*NET-SOC taxonomy with the 2010 SOC (Office of Management and Budget, 2010). Data from the O*NET 15.0 database (O*NET-SOC 2009) has been incorporated into the new O*NET-SOC 2010 taxonomy, including the new O*NET-SOC codes, titles, and descriptions. For 838 data-level occupations, the data remains unchanged from its publication in the O*NET 15.0 database. This occurs where the O*NET-SOC 2010 occupation is a clear successor of the O*NET-SOC 2009 occupation. There are 6 exceptional cases where data has been aggregated from one or more source occupations.

Changes made to the O*NET 15.1 Database are summarized below. A historical summary of all database changes since the release of the O*NET 4.0 Database are provided in O*NET Database Content Changes 5.0 - 15.1. In the O*NET 15.1 Database, 545 occupations had changes to their code, title, and/or description that are reflected in the Occupational Data file.

In 15.1, changes in the Domain Files fall into three categories:

50 occupations with data in the 15.0 release have a new O*NET-SOC Code in the 2010 taxonomy. The data and metadata for these occupations are unchanged, but the O*NET-SOC Code field now reflects the latest taxonomy. These code changes impact all domain files, and also the Occupation Level Metadata file.
6 exceptional occupations feature data aggregated from one or more occupations from the O*NET-SOC 2009 taxonomy. In these cases, “Recommend Suppress” and “Not Relevant” variables carry a “Y” value if ANY of the source occupations carried that value; no other metadata variables are included. Some data elements were not aggregated and are not present for these occupations, including all Education, Training, and Experience elements and all task ratings. These 6 occupations, listed below, will be updated through the O*NET Data Collection program with data from job incumbents and occupation experts.
 	13-1071.00	Human Resources Specialists
 	15-1143.00	Computer Network Architects
 	23-1012.00	Judicial Law Clerks
 	51-5112.00	Printing Press Operators
 	51-5113.00	Print Binding and Finishing Workers
 	51-9151.00	Photographic Process Workers and Processing Machine Operators
26 occupations newly added in the 2010 taxonomy carry new task statements, but not task ratings. This includes the 6 exceptional occupations cited above. With these additional statements, all 974 occupations in the O*NET Data Collection Plan carry full task lists in the 15.1 release.

O*NET Database 4.0 – Final Analyst Database

The O*NET 4.0 database represents the final version of an “analyst ratings only” O*NET Database. The ratings for each of the 900+ O*NET-SOC occupations in the 4.0 database were developed by occupational analysts and every occupation contains ratings for the same range of descriptors. The ongoing O*NET data collection program is gradually replacing these original analyst ratings with ratings derived primarily from job incumbents, as well as, ratings from an updated analyst procedure. The database structure and content changes incorporated in 4.0 were made to make the database consistent with data collection program. For more details about these changes, please refer to Summary of O*NET 4.0 Content Model and Database (October 2001) (http://www.onetcenter.org/resData.html#summary)
